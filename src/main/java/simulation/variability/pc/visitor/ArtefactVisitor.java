 * Interface for visitors on artefacts (see visitor pattern).
 * A visitor traverses a data structure (in this case the ArtefactTree).
 * For each possible element in the data structure, the visitor has a dedicated method that is invoked when this element
 * is detected.
 * Visitors can dictate how the visited data structure is traversed by instructing the given focus.
 * With the focus, further sub-structures (e.g., subtrees) can be traversed subsequently or entire parts of the data
 * can even by ignored.
