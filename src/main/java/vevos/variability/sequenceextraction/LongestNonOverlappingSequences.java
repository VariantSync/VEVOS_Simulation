     * <p>
     * The given commits are first filtered to only retain commits with exactly one parent that also must be contained in
     * the given collection. Then the sequences are determined. Considering branch/fork operations, each commit could
     * possible be part of multiple sequences if there is a branch/fork among its descendants. This function extracts
     * the longest sequence that is possible for a set of related commits (ancestors/descendants), i.e., the longest branch.
     * Afterwards, the second longest sequence is determined, then the third, and so on.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, if the commits comprise three partially overlapping sequences ([A-B-C-D-E], [X-Y-Z], [A-B-F-G]),
     * the function will return the sequences ([A-B-C-D-E], [X-Y-Z], [F-G]).
     * </p>

     * @return A function that has the properties described above.
